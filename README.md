# term_extraction

Consider "term_extraction.py" as the main code to be executed. The other python files are *mandatory* however. They are helper functions to generate the various text manipulation / replacement dictionaries, to avoid the primary code from being too terribly long.

Run those extended python files FIRST to generate the pickle files that will be picked up in the main program, so that it knows how to handle text. (All the files are pre-populated with our team's current work, so assuming you're working with the files in CS2.zip, you should have a good head-start).
